## Calculator extension for Visual Studio Code 
With this extension, you can use [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your calculator.
Just type a math expression in a text document, and once = key is pressed, the result will automatically appear.
For example, type this in a document:

    My monthly salary: 20*160=

Once the *=* key is typed, the result will be calculated, and the expression will look like this: 
    20*160=3200

More advanced expressions are also supported, for example:

    Price with tax: (120+40+60)*1.09=239.8  
  
**Enjoy!**
